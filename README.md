## Getting Started 🏁
Follow these steps to dive into the DV200 universe:

### Prerequisites 🛠️
Ensure you have the following tools:
- Verilog/SystemVerilog compiler (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- A simulator (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- Make (optional, for running scripts)

### Clone the Repository 🖥️
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dv200.git
cd dv200
```

## Toolchain Requirements 🧰
Make sure your environment is equipped with:
- **Verilog/SystemVerilog Compiler**: Tools like Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, or ModelSim.
- **Simulator**: To run the compiled designs.

## How to Use 🧑‍💻
### Compile a Design ⚙️
Navigate to the specific design directory and use the provided script:
```bash
cd designs/adder
../../scripts/compile_design.sh adder.v
```

### Run a Simulation 🎬
Execute the simulation for the desired testbench:
```bash
cd designs/adder
../../scripts/run_simulation.sh adder_tb.sv
```

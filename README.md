## Why DV200? 🤔
DV200 is more than just a collection of RTL designs. It's an educational playground:
- **Learn by Doing**: Hands-on examples of digital circuits. 🚀
- **End-to-End Projects**: Each design comes with a testbench, promoting a thorough understanding of both design and verification. 📚
- **Community Driven**: Contributions are welcome, making it a collaborative effort. 🤝


## Getting Started 🏁
Follow these steps to dive into the DV200 universe:

### Prerequisites 🛠️
Ensure you have the following tools:
- Verilog/SystemVerilog compiler (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- A simulator (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- Make (optional, for running scripts)

### Clone the Repository 🖥️
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nidhinchandran47/DV200.git
cd DV200
```

## Toolchain Requirements 🧰
Make sure your environment is equipped with:
- **Verilog/SystemVerilog Compiler**: Tools like Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, or ModelSim.
- **Simulator**: To run the compiled designs.
  
Or you can use online tools like **EDA Playground**

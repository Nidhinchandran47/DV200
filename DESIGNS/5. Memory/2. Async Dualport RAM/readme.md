# Asynchronous Dual-Port RAM

Asynchronous Dual-Port RAM (DPRAM) is a type of memory that allows simultaneous read and write operations on two different ports, each controlled by different clock signals. This is useful for applications requiring concurrent data access, such as video processing and networking.

#### Key Features:
1. **Dual-Port Access:** Supports simultaneous read and write operations on two independent ports.
2. **Synchronous Operation:** Operates in sync with a clock signal, ensuring precise timing.
3. **Read/Write Capabilities:** Each port can read from or write to the memory independently.

You can find [verilog code](ram.v) and [testbench](ram_tb.v) of the same here.

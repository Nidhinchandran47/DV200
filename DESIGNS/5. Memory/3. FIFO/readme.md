# FIFO ðŸ“¥

**First In First Out**

A sequential type of memory used to pass data between two asynchronous clock domains. Usually between two systems working in same clock but with different throughput.

### Uses of FIFO

- Avoid **Overflow**
  - Writing is faster than reading.
- Avoid **Underflow**
  - Writing is slower than reading.


You can find the [code](fifo.v) and [testbench](fifo_tb.v) of FIFO here, before that you need to know how to calculate the depth of the fifo. 

## Depth Calculation

Size of FIFO basically implies that how much data is required to buffer.
Consider the worst case while reading and writing. So the depth basically depend on the rate of reading and writing and the size of data.

#### CASE 3
~~~
Write Frequency < Read Frequency

<details>
    <summary>How to Proceed</summary>
    Depth of **1** is sufficient.

#### CASE 4
~~~
Write Frequency < Read Frequency  with idle clocks

> Time required to write one data item with considering idle   = $2*\frac{1}{F_w}$ = $\frac{2}{30M}$ = 66.67 ns

#### CASE 5
~~~
Write Frequency = Read Frequency
~~~

<details>
    <summary>How to Proceed</summary>
    No need of FIFO if clock are on phase,
    Depth of **1** is sufficient if clock are out of phase.

 #### CASE 6
~~~
Write Frequency = Read Frequency  with idle clocks

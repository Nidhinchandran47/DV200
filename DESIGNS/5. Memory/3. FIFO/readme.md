# FIFO ðŸ“¥

**First In First Out**

A sequential type of memory used to pass data between two asynchronous clock domains. Usually between two systems working in same clock but with different throughput.

### Uses of FIFO

- Avoid **Overflow**
  - Writing is faster than reading.
- Avoid **Underflow**
  - Writing is slower than reading.

## Depth Calculation

Size of FIFO basically implies that how much data is required to buffer.
Consider the worst case while reading and writing. So the depth basically depend on the rate of reading and writing and the size of data.

#### CASE 1
~~~
Write Frequency > Read Frequency

> Number of Data needed to store in FIFO = 120(Total data) - 75(read Data) = 45

#### CASE 2
~~~
Write Frequency > Read Frequency  with idle clocks

#### CASE 3
~~~
Write Frequency < Read Frequency

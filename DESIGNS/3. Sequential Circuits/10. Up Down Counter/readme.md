# Up Down Counter

An up-down counter is a type of digital counter capable of counting both upwards and downwards, depending on the control signal. 

It typically consists of flip-flops arranged in a sequence, where the count either increases (up) or decreases (down) with each clock pulse. In an up-counter mode, the counter progresses from a minimum to a maximum value. In down-counter mode, it decrements from the maximum to the minimum

# SISO (Serial-In Serial-Out - Shift Register )

A Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) shift register is a type of digital sequential circuit used to store and shift data. In a SISO shift register, data is input serially, one bit at a time, on each clock pulse, and is shifted through the register from one flip-flop to the next. The data eventually exits serially from the last flip-flop.

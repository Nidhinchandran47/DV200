# Ring Counter

A ring counter is a type of shift register in which the output of the last flip-flop is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop, forming a circular or "ring" connection. 

It is typically implemented with a series of D flip-flops connected in a chain, where only one flip-flop is set to '1' at any time, and the '1' bit circulates through the register with each clock pulse. 

Ring counters are commonly used for generating repetitive sequences, timing signals, and state machines.

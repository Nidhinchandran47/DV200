# Johnson Counter

A Johnson counter, also known as a twisted ring counter, is a type of shift register in digital electronics where the output of the last flip-flop is inverted and fed back to the input of the first flip-flop. 

It consists of a series of D flip-flops connected in a chain, with the output of each flip-flop connected to the input of the next. The Johnson counter generates a unique sequence of states, typically twice the number of flip-flops used, making it useful for applications like sequence generation, clock division, and digital displays.

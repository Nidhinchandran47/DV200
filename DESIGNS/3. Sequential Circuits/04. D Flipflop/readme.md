# D Flip-flop

A D flip-flop, also known as a data or delay flip-flop, is a fundamental memory element in digital electronics. It captures the value of the input data (D) at a specific portion of the clock cycle (typically the rising edge) and holds this value until the next clock edge. The D flip-flop ensures that the output (Q) only changes at well-defined times, making it essential for synchronous circuit design.

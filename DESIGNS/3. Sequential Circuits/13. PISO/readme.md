# PISO (Parallel-In-Serial-Out Shift Register )

A Parallel-In-Serial-Out (PISO) shift register is a type of digital sequential circuit used to store and shift data. In a PISO shift register, data is input parallely when load is enabled, on each clock pulse, and is shifted through the register from one flip-flop to the next. The data eventually exits serially from the last flip-flop.

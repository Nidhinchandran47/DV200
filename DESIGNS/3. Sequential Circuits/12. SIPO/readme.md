# SIPO (Serial-In Parallel-Out Shift Register )

A Serial-In Parallel-Out (SIPO) shift register is a type of digital sequential circuit used to store and shift data. In a SIPO shift register, data is input serially, one bit at a time, on each clock pulse, and is shifted through the register from one flip-flop to the next. The data  exits parallely through each flip-flop.

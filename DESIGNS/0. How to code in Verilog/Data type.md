## ‚≠ï Data Type 

[Homeüè†](readme.md)

The set of Verilog HDL data types is designed to represent the data storage and transmission elements found in digital hardware.

The Verilog HDL value set consists of four basic values:

- **0** - represents a logic zero, or a false condition
- **1** - represents a logic one, or a true condition
- **x** - represents an unknown logic value
- **z** - represents a high-impedance state

> [!TIP]
>There are two main groups of data types: the **variable** data types and the **net** data types.

###  Net declarations

The net data types can represent physical connections between structural entities, such as gates. A net shall not store a value.Instead, its value shall be determined by the values of its drivers, such as a continuous assignment or a gate.  . If no driver is connected to a net, its value shall be high-impedance (z). The default initialization value for a net shall be the value z.

Examples: `supply0 | supply1
| tri | triand | trior | tri0 | tri1 | uwire | wire | wand | wor`

###  Variable declarations

A variable is an abstraction of a data storage element. A variable shall store a value from one assignment to the next. An assignment statement in a procedure acts as a trigger that changes the value in the data storage element. The initialization value for **reg, time, and integer** data types shall be the unknown value, x. The default initialization value for **real and realtime** variable data types shall be 0.0.

> [!NOTE]
> In previous versions of this standard, the term *register* was used to encompass the reg, integer, time, real, andrealtime types, but that term is no longer used as a Verilog data type.

> [!CAUTION]
> Nets and variables can be assigned negative values, but only integer, real, realtime, and signed reg variables and signed nets shall retain the significance of the sign. Time and unsigned reg variables and unsigned nets shall treat the value assigned to them as an unsigned value. 

### **Vector**

A *net* or *reg* declaration without a range specification shall be considered 1 bit wide and is known as a **scalar**. Multibit net and reg data types shall be declared by specifying a range, which is known as a **vector**.

```verilog
wand w;                       // a scalar net of type "wand"
tri [15:0] busa;              // a three-state 16-bit bus
trireg (small) storeit;       // a charge storage node of strength small
reg a;                        // a scalar reg
reg[3:0] v;                   // a 4-bit vector reg made up of (from most to 
                              // least significant)v[3], v[2], v[1], and v[0]
reg signed [3:0] signed_reg;  // a 4-bit vector in range -8 to 7
reg [-1:4] b;                 // a 6-bit vector reg
wire w1, w2;                  // declares two wires
reg [4:0] x, y, z;            // declares three 5-bit regs
```

### **Strengths**

Two types of strengths can be specified in a net declaration as follows:

- Charge strength shall only be used when declaring a net of type trireg.
- Drive strength shall only be used when placing a continuous assignment on a net in the same statement that declares the net.

Different strengths are
- Small
- Medium
- Large

Default strength of **trireg** net is **medium**

```verilog
trireg a;                        // trireg net of charge strength medium
trireg (large) #(0,0,50) cap1;   // trireg net of charge strength large
                                 // with charge decay time 50 time units
trireg (small)signed [3:0] cap2; // signed 4-bit trireg vector of
                                 // charge strength small 
```


### **Parameters**

Verilog HDL parameters do not belong to either the variable or the net group. Parameters are not variables; they are constants. There are two types of parameters: module parameters and specify parameters.

```verilog
parameter msb = 7;                 // defines msb as a constant value 7
parameter e = 25, f = 9;           // defines two constant numbers
parameter r = 5.7;                 // declares r as a real parameter
parameter [31:0] dec_const = 1'b1; // value converted to 32 bits
parameter newconst = 3'h4;         // implied range of [2:0]
parameter newconst = 4;            // implied range of at least [31:0]
```

**localparam** are identical to parameters except that they cannot directly be modified by **defparam** statements or module instance parameter value assignments.

The keyword **specparam** declares a special type of parameter that is intended only for providing timing and
delay values, but can appear in any expression that is not assigned to a parameter and is not part of the range
specification of a declaration.

### Bidirectional Buffer

A bidirectional buffer, also known as a bidirectional transceiver, is a digital circuit that enables data transmission between two buses in both directions. This is achieved using control signals for enabling the buffer and determining the direction of data flow.

#### Key Features
- **Dual Data Flow:** Allows data to be transferred from bus A to bus B and vice versa.
- **Control Signals:**
  - **Enable (EN):** Activates the buffer for data transmission.
  - **Direction (DIR):** Determines the direction of data flow. When DIR is low, data flows from A to B; when DIR is high, data flows from B to A.
- **High-Impedance State:** When the buffer is disabled (EN is low), both buses are in a high-impedance state, effectively disconnecting them.

#### Applications
- **Bus Interface:** Used in bus systems to control data flow between different parts of a circuit.
- **Memory Access:** Enables data exchange between a CPU and memory.
- **Communication Systems:** Facilitates bidirectional communication in systems where two devices need to send and receive data.
